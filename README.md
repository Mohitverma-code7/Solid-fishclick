# 📊 UI & HTML Code Evaluation Report

This repository documents the evaluation of a submitted frontend project.  
The project was reviewed against basic UI, HTML, and code quality standards.

**Final Score: 10 / 100**

The low score reflects fundamental issues in HTML structure, semantics, and code readability.

---

## 🧮 Marks Breakdown

Each section carried **20 marks**.  
Only **2 marks per section** were awarded due to severe violations of basic standards.

---

## ❌ Reasons for Low Score

### 1. Improper Page Structure (Header / Main / Body)
- Multiple headers and main bodies used incorrectly
- Page structure is not clearly defined
- No single, logical flow of content
- HTML outline is broken and confusing

---

### 2. Incorrect Table Structure (`thead` / `tbody`)
- `<thead>` and `<tbody>` are missing or misused
- Table rows and headings are not semantically separated
- Reduces accessibility and data clarity
- Indicates lack of understanding of table semantics

---

### 3. No Use of `<section>` Elements
- Content blocks are not grouped using `<section>`
- Page lacks meaningful content segmentation
- Makes the document structure unclear for both users and screen readers

---

### 4. Improper Use of Bold Lists
- Lists rely on `<b>` or `<strong>` instead of proper list semantics
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` are either missing or misused
- Visual styling is prioritized over correct HTML structure

---

### 5. Poor Use of Semantic HTML
- Overuse of generic `<div>` elements
- Semantic tags such as:
  - `<header>`
  - `<main>`
  - `<section>`
  - `<nav>`
  - `<footer>`
  are missing or incorrectly applied
- HTML does not convey meaning or intent

---

### 6. Code Readability Issues
- Inconsistent indentation and formatting
- Poor naming conventions
- Difficult to read and understand
- Code is not maintainable or scalable

---

## 🚫 Summary of Problems
- Weak understanding of semantic HTML
- Broken document structure
- Accessibility not considered
- Poor readability and maintainability
- Does not meet basic frontend development standards

---

## ✅ Suggestions for Improvement
- Learn proper **HTML document structure**
- Use **semantic elements** instead of `<div>` everywhere
- Follow correct **table semantics**
- Use lists correctly (`ul`, `ol`, `li`)
- Improve **code formatting and naming**
- Validate HTML using standard validators

---

## 📝 Final Remarks
This evaluation is intentionally strict.  
The current code quality is far below acceptable standards for frontend development.  
Major rework is required before reassessment.
